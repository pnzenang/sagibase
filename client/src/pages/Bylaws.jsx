              1.1. PURPOSE OF INTERNAL RULES & REGULATIONS.
            </span>
            <br /> The purpose of the \nInternal Rules & Regulations is to
            ensure the smooth running and proper functioning of the
            organization. The Internal Rules & Regulations will provide
            guidelines on maintaining the organizations vision, harboring a
            close and supportive relationship between the bureau/board and the
            delegates, resolving confusion, facilitating daily activities, and
            improving the management of the bureau/board. <br />
            The following Internal Rules & Regulations effectively serve as the
            Bylaws of this organization. <br />
            <br />
            The Internal Rules & Regulations should serve as a living document
            to the organization’s officers, presidents of associations, and
            delegates. This is a set of rules that every association member
            should abide by. The Internal Rules & Regulations shall be available
            to every SAGI association/member of the organization through the
            website or provided via electronic mail.

            the organization including the management of funds. Individuals
            belonging to associations that are members of SAGI do not have a

            operation of the organization including the management of its funds
            and the conduct of its officers. SAGI employees are indemnified by
            SAGI for work done on SAGI's behalf. 15.3. ATTORNEY FEES In any
            litigation, arbitration, or other proceedings in which SAGI is the
            prevailing party, SAGI shall collect from the non-prevailing party,
            its reasonable attorneys' fees incurred.

            <br /> Any death must be reported to the SAGI bureau within seven
            (7) days from the date of death; after this period, the death is no
            longer considered by SAGI and contributions will not be provided by
            SAGI. To preserve the privacy of the deceased, associations and
            families are encouraged, but not required to conceal the cause of
            death, usually mentioned on the death certificate, before providing
            it to SAGI. <br /> <br />{' '}

            <br />
            SAGI does not deal with paperwork. This task falls to the family
            concerned with the death. Ergo, SAGI does not retain any documents
            pertaining to deaths or the individual families. SAGI maintains no
            records.

            </span>
            All active member associations should take part in the ongoing
            contributions, even if the death of the individual occurred before
            their matriculation. <br /> <br />

            The fixed amount to be collected is $20,000.00 (twenty thousand
            dollars) per death. This amount is divided among all active members
            in member associations, and each association’s contribution depends
            on the total number of individuals belonging to that association.
            The amount of the contribution cannot be modified after the list is
            sent out. <br /> <br />{' '}

            The due date of contributions is seven (7) days after the
            contribution table is sent out by the SAGI Bureau/Board. Member
            associations are strongly encouraged to make their contributions as
            soon as the list of contributions is published, without waiting for
            the 7th day deadline. The official announcement of death is only
            made after the SAGI Bureau/Board receives the required documents as
            outlined above. <br />

            death is announced to SAGI after seven (7) days. The individual died
            while in Cameroon. The deceased person was cremated. <br /> <br />{' '}
